You are rebuilding the WOS Packaging website (https://www.w-o-s.co.za
).
This is NOT an online store — products are showcased only, with quote requests instead of checkout.

The site must feel:

Industrial

Minimal

Product-led

Easy to scan

B2B-focused

Technical Requirements

The codebase must support:

Next.js / React

Typescript

Tailwind CSS

shadcn/ui project structure

Framer Motion

If the project does not already support these:

Provide setup instructions using shadcn CLI

Explain why /components/ui must exist and be used

Install required dependencies

Default component path:
/components/ui

Hero Section (Adapted from DicedHeroSection)

Use the provided DicedHeroSection React component as the visual and structural reference, but adapt it for a packaging manufacturer.

Hero Intent

Immediately communicate what WOS does

Visually showcase packaging products, not lifestyle imagery

No promotional language like “Shop Now”

Hero Content Changes

Replace demo content with:

Top text: “WOS Packaging”

Main headline: “Packaging Solutions That Perform”

Sub text: Short B2B value statement (custom packaging, materials, scale)

Primary CTA: “View Products” or “Request a Quote”

Image Grid Behavior

Use 4 product-related images (boxes, bags, packaging materials)

Clicking images should navigate to product category pages

Hover states are allowed, but subtle

Product Showcase (Core Focus)

Immediately after the hero:

Product Grid

Strong grid system

No pricing

No cart

No checkout

Each product card includes:

Product image

Product name

Short description

CTA: “View Details”

Filters:

Structure prepared for categories (future-ready)

Not required to be functional yet

Product Detail Pages

Each product has its own page.

Include:

Large product image

Clear product title

Specifications table

Customisation options

Quote request form

Name

Company

Email

Quantity

Message

CTA must say “Request a Quote”, never “Buy” or “Add to Cart”.

Questions the AI Should Consider (Internally)

What props should be passed into the hero?

What product data structure will scale best?

How should the hero behave responsively?
